  * row – primary collision factor
    * sort by: countA of primary collision factor
  * value – primary collision factor
    * summarize by: countA

3. pivot table: collision type
  * row – collision day of week
    * sort by: countA of collison type
  * row – collision type
    * sort by: countA of collision type
  * value – collision type
    * summarize by: countA

4. pivot table: parties involved
  * row – involved with
    * sort by: countA of involved with
  * value – involved with
    * summarize by: countA
    * summarize by: show as % of column

5. pivot table: 2017 collision involvement
