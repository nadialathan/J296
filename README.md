# J296 Final Project: Data analysis + visualization + documentation

### Story summarization

Motor vehicle collisions are on the rise in California and across the country – a trend that has accelerated since the pandemic begun in 2020. However, the opposite is true in Richmond, Calif. where collisions have steadily declined over the last four years. Through careful data analysis and with the power of Google Sheets, I examine how Richmond compares to the rest of the state on traffic safety.

### Where high speeds meet open roadways
Speeding is the number one cause of roadway collisions in California, according to the Transportation Injury Mappying System from the Safe Transportation Research and Education Center at Unversity of California, Berkeley. The same is true nationally, where [speeding accounts for about one-third of all motor vehicle collisions](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding)and has been the case for two decades.

This trend is [well supported by academic research](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/08%20-%20The%20Relation%20Between%20Speed%20and%20Crashes.pdf) that shows the likelihood for collision increases as speed increases, in addition to the severity of injury.

The same is true in Richmond where 1,134 collisons occured due to unsafe speeding from 2018 to Janurary 2023.

Of the four most common reaons for collision – unsafe speed, improper turning, traffic signals and signs, and failure to yield – 20% were due to drivers exceeding the speed limit. Although not quite as high as the national average (29%), speeding plays a significant role in disrupting traffic safety.

Why the sense of urgency?

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, traffic congestion and tardiness are common reasons for why drivers begin to maneuver at dangerous speeds. As people sit in traffic, they become agitated when the speed they were traveling at gets interrupted. Running late for, say, an appointment or interview, also causes drivers to push against the flow of traffic. Although Richmond has, in general, seen a steady decline in unsafe speeding collisions, more and more motorists are hitting the roadways as [Alameda County slowly returns to pre-pandemic levels of vehicle mileage](https://tims.berkeley.edu/covid19.php), which, in part, fosters conditions for unsafe driving.

### Car collisions have declined over the past four years in Richmond

Motor vehicle collisions hit a high point of 72 incidents in March 2018 with a total of nearly 700 crashes that year, and haven't reached the same level since.

There's a sharp drop from February through April in 2020 because of the pandemic, and incidents reached a historic low of 23 collisions in April. The same time last year had about two and half times more motor vehicle collisions. However, likely due to significantly less roadway traffic, crashes decreased overall by 6% from 2019 to 2020.

This decline is even steeper between 2021 and 2022, **where annual crashes fell by 20%.**, denoting a pattern that's in stark contrast with the rest of state, as total crashes fell by roughly 6% within the same time frame across California per the [UC Berkeley Transportation Injury Mapping System](https://tims.berkeley.edu/covid19.php).

Although there aren't clear explanations for why this is the case – and is something I would like to further explore with the sources I have identified – the city has allocated numerous resources towards alternative modes of transportation in the last four years which may partially explain the consistent fall in crashes.

The Department of Transportation has introduced bike share and EV carshare services (both to varying degress of success – the former which was phased out in 2021 but has since returned) all within the last four years, and expansive projects to improve high-injury corridors such as San Pablo Avenue have been in development for even longer. The precise driving force behind these trends remains to be further investigated.
