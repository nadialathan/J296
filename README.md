# J296 Final Project: Data analysis + visualization + documentation

## By Nadia Lathan

Motor vehicle collisions are on the rise in California and across the country – a trend that has accelerated since the pandemic begun in 2020. However, the opposite is true in Richmond, Calif. where collisions have steadily declined over the last four years. Through careful data analysis and with the power of Google Sheets, I examine how Richmond compares to the rest of the state on traffic safety.

### Where high speeds meet open roadways
Unsafe speeding is the number one cause for roadway collisions in California, according to the Transportation Injury Mappying System from the Safe Transportation Research and Education Center at Unversity of California, Berkeley. The same is true nationally, where [speeding accounts for about one-third of all motor vehicle collisions](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding)and has been the case for two decades.

This trend is [well supported by academic research](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/08%20-%20The%20Relation%20Between%20Speed%20and%20Crashes.pdf) that shows the likelihood for collision increases as speed increases, in addition to the severity of injury.

The same is true in Richmond, where 1,134 collisons occured due to unsafe speeding from 2018 to Janurary 2023.

Of the four most common reaons for collision – unsafe speed, improper turning, traffic signals and signs, and failure to yield – 20% were due to drivers exceeding the speed limit. Although not quite as high as the national average (29%), speeding plays a significant role in disrupting traffic safety.

Why all the sense of urgency?

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, traffic congestion and tardiness are common reasons for why drivers begin to maneuver at dangerous speeds. As people sit in traffic, they become agitated when the speed they were traveling at gets interrupted. Running late for, say, an appointment or interview, also causes drivers to push against the flow of traffic. Although Richmond has seen a steady decline every year since 2018 in regard to collisions caused by speeding, more and more motorists are hitting the roadways as [Alameda County slowly returns to pre-pandemic levels of vehicle mileage](https://tims.berkeley.edu/covid19.php), which, in part, fosters conditions for unsafe driving.
